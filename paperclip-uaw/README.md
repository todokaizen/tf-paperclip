# Paperclip-UAW v1

Paperclip-specific integration layer built on top of UAW v3 (Unambiguous Agentic Workflow).

## Relationship to UAW v3

UAW v3 is the base protocol — a lightweight operating system for a solo developer
working with AI agents. It defines file structure, session protocols, authority order,
and verification rules.

Paperclip-UAW v1 extends UAW v3 with three amendments for multi-agent pipeline
orchestration (see `amendments.md`). The templates in `templates/` include these
amendments baked into the CLAUDE.md contract.

The original UAW v3 source documents are preserved in `upstream/` for reference.

## Usage

Copy templates into any project repo:

```bash
cp -r paperclip-uaw/templates/ /path/to/project/
```

Then fill in `resume.md` with the project state. Agents read `CLAUDE.md` on
startup and follow the UAW protocol autonomously.

## Amendments (v1)

1. **Multi-Agent Session Handoff** — sequential agents complete shutdown before
   the next starts; incoming agent reads resume.md as starting context
2. **Role Scoping** — agents operate within their assigned role boundary
   (spec_writer, executor, reviewer, etc.)
3. **Externally Assigned Phase** — phase comes from the task creator, not the agent

## Version History

- **v1 (2026-03-31)** — Initial Paperclip-UAW integration. Three amendments for
  multi-agent orchestration. Based on UAW v3 (March 2026).
